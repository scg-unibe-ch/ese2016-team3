#### Placement of advertisements

A real estate manager can create a new advertisement for real estate. An advertisement consists of required general information and additonal optional information about the real estate it concerns.

The advertiser can specify, whether he wants to sell or rent a real estate by choosing the appropriate tab "buy" or "rent" before placing the ad.

The following general information can be declared:

#### Auctions

When an ad is up for sale and the owner has chosen the *auction* option, users can bid on the property. There is also a "buy directly" price. Both startprice for bidding and bidding increment is specified by the property owner, as is the direct buy price. The auction has an end date when it is no longer possible to bid.

#### User roles

As already mentioned, the application distinguishes two different user types: *premium* and *normal*.

The application behaves different for the different user roles as follows:

- If a new advertisement meets the filter criteria of an alert of a premium user, he immediately gets a message by the internal system mail box and by email.
- In the same situation, a normal user gets a summary of all triggered alerts once a day. The summary is sent to the internal system mail box and also by email.
- The advertisement of premium users are shown at the top of the search result list.

A normal user can upgrade to premium for a choice of durations with different prices. For this he has to give his credit card information. After the amount of days he has paid for has passed, the user is reverted back to normal status, the premium membership has run out. It is not possible to cancel the premium subscription since it is paid for in full.

#### Enquiries

A user can send an enquiry to a certain visiting time of a flat on that flat's advertisment page. All he needs to do is find the *Visiting Times* table on the flat's page and click the *Send enquiry to advertiser* button next to the date he'd like to visit the flat and his enquiry will show up on the owner of that flat's *Enquiry* page.

A logged in user can see his enquiries by choosing "Enquiries" from the Profile drop-down menu. There he sees a table of enquiries sent to him entailing the following: 

- *Sender*: The user name of the person who sent the enquiry,
- *Ad*: The address of the flat the enquiry has been sent for,

- *Actions*: Two buttons _decline_ and _accept_ where the user gives feedback to the sender on whether he accepts or declines the enquiry. After accepting or declining, the user can undo his choice by clicking the _undo_ button.

**NEW** A user can see the auction for a property he wants to sell with information about who bid and how much.

**NEW** A user who bid in an auction can see a list of all the properties he bid for and what their current state is.
