## Auction Management

### Scenario 1

#### Description

### Scenario 2

You have placed a nice house in Grossh√∂chstetten under auction. The auction should still be running. The house is not in a very good state. So you decided for yourself that if someone wants to buy it directly for `Fr. 1'200'000.-` you would stop the auction immediately and contact the person to sell the property directly to her. Because you don't expect the bids to get that high.

You should now check your auctions.

In addition your accommodation should have a balcony, it should have between `1` and `4` rooms, it should be newly renovated (`Renovation year after 2000`) and shopping centres should not be farther away than `1000 meters`. 

Between 1st and the 13th December, you want to be able to move in.

You want to have a closer look at the search results and use the map to have a look at the neighborhood. You open an ad based on the map view.

You filter the returned results, so the most expansive ad appears on top.
