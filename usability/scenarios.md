### Scenario 2

You have placed a nice house in Grossh√∂chstetten under auction. The auction should still be running. The house is not in a very good state. So you decided for yourself that if someone wants to buy it directly for `Fr. 1'200'000.-` you would stop the auction immediately and contact the person to sell the property directly to her. Because you don't expect the bids to get that high.

You should now check your auctions.
