# Usability scenarios

## Auction Management

### Scenario 1

#### Description

You have placed a lovely studio in Bern under auction. You remember that the auction should have expired recently.

Now you want to check, whether someone has bidden for the studio.

If this is the case, you would like to contact the bidder who bade most to discuss the formalities of purchasing.

### Scenario 2

You have placed a nice house in Grossh√∂chstetten under auction. The auction should still be running. The house is not in a very good state. So you decided for yourself that if someone wants to buy it directly for `Fr. 1'200'000.-` you would stop the auction immediately and contact the person to sell the property directly to her. Because you don't expect the bids to get that high.

You should now check your auctions.
