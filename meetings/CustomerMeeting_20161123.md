### Traktanden

#### Place Ad

- Date: can't find arrows to go to other month
- Start price and start date should be two words
- format more user friendly
- too many criteria
- FIND AD should be more obvious

#### Search Ad

- should say max price
- index out of bounds for price?
- sorting is not obvious, put it to the results, not the filters
- map is too big. Should be able to choose between map and list!
- number of rooms should be more obvious and on top, same with price

#### Manage Auctions

- can't find manage auctions
- can't get around manage auctions page but once he finds it it's good
- went to his own ads first, should have a link to manage auctions
- when auction is expired, auction should not be public anymore
- immediate messages to owner and winner after expiration of auction, to make arrangement

#### Bidding

- should delete everything you've searched for before 
- villa/house distinction?
- not visible what the current price exactly is?
- can't find out where he can see whether he bid the current price
- make header smaller, a lot of useless space
- filter is way too long, shouldn't be that far down
- better use of space in general
- link to list about who bid on an auction (on current price)

#### Other

- tomcat/glassfish container management instead of jetty
- maven plugin 
- map with all ads is low priority
-
